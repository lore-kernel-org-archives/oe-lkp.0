Hi Linus, sorry for this late report. I can't figure out exact reason but s=
ome possible clues.

The issue is captured by rcutoture which doesn't work well before. And only=
 from late october,
we have solved a few issues of the execution including the rootfs (yocto) i=
t is using. And this issue
is against an randconfig, i'm not sure whether the issue depends on a certa=
in kconfig thus only
be triggered or successfully bisected this time.
