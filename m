So my patch does not release bdi in del_gendisk(). Bdi has two
initialization / destruction phases (similarly to request queue). You
allocate and initialize bdi through bdi_init(), then you call
bdi_register() to register it (which happens in device_add_disk()). On
shutdown you have to first call bdi_unregister() (used to be called from
blk_cleanup_queue(), my patch moved it to del_gendisk()). After that the
last reference to bdi may be dropped which does final bdi destruction.

So do I understand correctly that SCSI may call device_add_disk(),
del_gendisk() repeatedly for the same request queue? If yes, then indeed I
have a bug to fix... But gendisk seems to get allocated from scratch on
each probe so we don't call device_add_disk(), del_gendisk() more times on
the same disk, right?

Yep, I guess that's caused by Dan's patch (commit 0dba1314d4f8 now) which
calls put_disk_devt() only in blk_cleanup_queue() which, if I understood
you correctly, does not get called during unbind-bind cycle? In fact Dan's
patch would end up leaking devt's because of repeated device_add_disk()
calls for the same request queue...

Yep, I think the binding of request queue to different gendisks is
something I or Dan did not expect.
