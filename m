This patch introduces an heuristic that reduces latency when the
I/O-request pool is saturated. This goal is achieved by disabling
device idling, for non-weight-raised queues, when there are weight-
raised queues with pending or in-flight requests. In fact, as
explained in more detail in the comment on the function
bfq_bfqq_may_idle(), this reduces the rate at which processes
associated with non-weight-raised queues grab requests from the pool,
thereby increasing the probability that processes associated with
weight-raised queues get a request immediately (or at least soon) when
they need one. Along the same line, if there are weight-raised queues,
then this patch halves the service rate of async (write) requests for
non-weight-raised queues.

+	 * to ask for a lower number of requests from the request
+	 * pool, before the busy weight-raised queues get served
