Yes, you're right, although we have auto report feature (which has much
less delay) for high confidence errors/regressions detected, we still need
human sanity check for other cases to avoid too many false positives, it
will introduce some delays especially in weekend, sorry for that. We'll
improve our auto report part to cover more sensible cases.

Good point! We'll add this feature later.
