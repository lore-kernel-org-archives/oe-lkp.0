I think that the schedutil governor should be tested too if present.

Also note that for the intel_pstate driver "powersave" may mean
different things depending on the current operation mode of the
driver.  If scaling_driver is "intel_pstate", then "powersave" is the
driver's built-in algorithm.  If scaling_driver is "intel_cpufreq",
though, "powersave" means running at the minimum frequency all the
time.
