I do have found this problem on linux next 20190528 on x86_64, i386,
arm64 and arm architectures.
But, this failure is not easy to reproduce.
so thought of sharing report with steps to reproduce and got delayed.

However, Thanks for looking into this problem.
I will keep monitoring this mmap16 failure and let you know when it
will get fixed.
