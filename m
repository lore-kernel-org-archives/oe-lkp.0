Mimi I have two questions:

a) Is the keyid enough to distinguish the security.ima and security.evm
   xattrs of one container from another container and from native?  Or
   do we have some important security xattrs that are associated with
   keys that don't have a keyid?

b) Can we reasonably live with a limitation that the native and the
   namespace'd policies don't intersect?  Or in the case of an
   interesection the native policy is the only one that is executed?

I submit that if the answer is keyids are always present, and we can
live with the native policy taking precedence over the container policy
then we have a solution to the IMA xattrs.
