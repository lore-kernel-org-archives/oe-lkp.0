Got it. I wonder if running trinity in root mode (in QEMU, of course)
will help catch more bugs. If so, I'd like to keep the current state,
but ignore the known trinity specific oops (like this one and OOM). We
already have the code to ignore trinity triggered OOM, so it'd be
trivial to add one more oops pattern to ignore.

Thanks,
Fengguang
