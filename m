I have checked the source code of will-it-scale/page_fault3.  Yes, it
exactly does that.

      0.00            +8.5        8.49   5%  perf-profile.calltrace.cycles-=
pp.flush_tlb_func.__flush_smp_call_function_queue.__sysvec_call_function.sy=
svec_call_function.asm_sysvec_call_function

From perf profiling, the cycles for TLB flushing increases much.  So I
guess it may be related?

Will ask 0-Day guys to check this.
