Yes.  The upper drivers (sd, sr, st and sg) follow a device model. =

 They can thus be bound and unbound many times during the lifetime of a
SCSI device.

Right, gendisk, being a generic representation of a disk is a property
of the upper layer drivers.  We actually cheat and use it in all of
them (including the apparent character ones, they use alloc_disk,
put_disk but not add_disk).  So it has to be freed when the driver is
unbound and reallocated when it is bound.  It's the fundamental entity
which embeds the SCSI upper layer driver lifetime.

That's a bit unfortunate.

OK, so I think we now understand why this is happening ... the question
is what we do about it?  Is it fixable or do we need to go back to
basics?  The fundamental property which got broken by these patches is
the idea of the separation of the lifecycles of the queue and the
gendisk.  The only requirement is that the queue must exist before the
gendisk is created and must be destroyed after it.  This doesn't forbid
there being many gendisk lifetimes over one queue lifetime and this is
what we rely on for the SCSI driver model.  We rarely get called on it
because unbind/rebind of a ULD is rarely done in production (it's
mostly a devtest thing).
