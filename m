Yeah, something along those lines maybe. I don't think we can use
fl_blocker that way though, as the wait_event_interruptible is waiting
on it to go to NULL, and the wake_up happens before fl_blocker is
cleared.

Maybe we need to mix in some sort of FL_BLOCK_ACTIVE flag and use that
instead of testing for !fl_blocker to see whether we can avoid the
blocked_lock_lock?
