It should be only data here. text changes all the time anyways,
but data tends to be more stable.

I wonder if it's the effect Andrew predicted a long time ago from
using __read_mostly. If all the __read_mostlies are moved somewhere
else the remaining read/write variables will get more sensitive to false sh=
aring.

A simple experiment would be to add a __cacheline_aligned to align it,
and then add

____cacheline_aligned char dummy[0]; =


at the end to pad it to 64bytes.

Or hopefully Jiri can figure it out from the C2C data.

Yes we've had similar problems with the data segment before.
