Joe's a junior devop who has been given a container
template which he tweaks for various nefarious purposes.
He doesn't know much about what he's doing. He isn't
changing the UIDs the template uses because, quite frankly,
he doesn't know a UID from an entrenching tool. He has
changed a filesystem from RO to RW because he read on a
forum somewhere that doing so would fix a problem he had
once. He doesn't want to have that problem again, so he
left the change in the template.

Containers are being sold as a way to make things easier.
This sort of side effect is dangerous in an environment
where users are being told that they don't have to worry
so much, the environment will take care of them. =

The right way to look at the problem is to identify the
capabilities the program ought to have and set the file
capabilities and UID/GID properly on the program on the
base system. If you have to fix the program so it works
right under those conditions, so much the better for
everyone. If you're running with different capabilities
in a container to prevent the program from doing damage
to the base system, maybe the program needs fixing instead.

The UID is the wrong association. The namespace is the correct association.
You're using the UID because it's something that's different in the
namespace than in the base system. You can detect it. What you need is a
non-volatile namespace id to attach to the file rather than using the
UID mapping (which may not be unique) that the namespace uses.
