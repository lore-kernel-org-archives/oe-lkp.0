It's nice to have a good laugh, however I would really appreciate if any
of you would help me to fix the test.

The test in question is a regression test for:

commit f67b15037a7a50c57f72e69a6d59941ad90a0f0f

    perf/hwbp: Simplify the perf-hwbp code, fix documentation

    Annoyingly, modify_user_hw_breakpoint() unnecessarily complicates the
    modification of a breakpoint - simplify it and remove the pointless
    local variables.

And as far as I can tell it uses ptrace() with PTRACE_POKEUSER in order to
trigger it. But I'm kind of lost on how exactly we trigger the kernel
crash.

What is does is to write:

	(void*)1 to u_debugreg[0]
	(void*)1 to u_debugreg[7]
	do_debug addr to u_debugreg[0]

Looking at the kernel code the write to register 7 enables the breakpoints =
and
what we attempt here is to change an invalid address to a valid one after we
enabled the breakpoint but that's as far I can go.

So does anyone has an idea how to trigger the bug without the do_debug func=
tion
address? Would any valid kernel function address suffice?
