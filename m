heh I was actually looking at the reader code. We really do:

	/* wait until we successfully acquire the lock */
	set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
	while (true) {
		if (rwsem_try_write_lock(count, sem))
			break;
		raw_spin_unlock_irq(&sem->wait_lock);

		/* Block until there are no active lockers. */
		do {
			schedule();
			set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
		} while ((count =3D sem->count) & RWSEM_ACTIVE_MASK);

		raw_spin_lock_irq(&sem->wait_lock);
	}


Which still has similar issues with even two barriers, I guess for both
the rwsem_try_write_lock call (less severe) and count checks. Anyway...
