Hi Aaron,

Jirka Hladky has reported a regression with that changeset as
well, and I have already spent some time debugging the issue.

I added tracing code to task_numa_compare() and saw a number
of thread swaps with tiny improvements.

Does preventing those help your workload, or am I barking up
the wrong tree again?  (I have been looking at this for a while...)

Subject: sched,numa: prevent task moves with marginal benefit

Commit a43455a1d57 makes task_numa_migrate() always check the
preferred node for task placement. This is causing a performance
regression with hackbench, as well as SPECjbb2005.

Tracing task_numa_compare() with a single instance of SPECjbb2005
on a 4 node system, I have seen several thread swaps with tiny
improvements. =


It appears that the hysteresis code that was added to task_numa_compare
is not doing what we needed it to do, and a simple threshold could be
better.
