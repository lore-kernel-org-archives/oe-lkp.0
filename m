This patch introduces a simple heuristic to load applications quickly,
and to perform the I/O requested by interactive applications just as
quickly. To this purpose, both a newly-created queue and a queue
associated with an interactive application (we explain in a moment how
BFQ decides whether the associated application is interactive),
receive the following two special treatments:

1) The weight of the queue is raised.

2) The queue unconditionally enjoys device idling when it empties; in
fact, if the requests of a queue are sync, then performing device
idling for the queue is a necessary condition to guarantee that the
queue receives a fraction of the throughput proportional to its weight
(see [1] for details).

For brevity, we call just weight-raising the combination of these
two preferential treatments. For a newly-created queue,
weight-raising starts immediately and lasts for a time interval that:
1) depends on the device speed and type (rotational or
non-rotational), and 2) is equal to the time needed to load (start up)
a large-size application on that device, with cold caches and with no
additional workload.

Finally, as for guaranteeing a fast execution to interactive,
I/O-related tasks (such as opening a file), consider that any
interactive application blocks and waits for user input both after
starting up and after executing some task. After a while, the user may
trigger new operations, after which the application stops again, and
so on. Accordingly, the low-latency heuristic weight-raises again a
queue in case it becomes backlogged after being idle for a
sufficiently long (configurable) time. The weight-raising then lasts
for the same time as for a just-created queue.

According to our experiments, the combination of this low-latency
heuristic and of the improvements described in the previous patch
allows BFQ to guarantee a high application responsiveness.

+ * In particular, R is the peak rate of the reference device (see below),

+ * Accordingly, the longer/shorter BFQ grants weight raising to interactive
+ * applications.
+ *

+	 * situation is when requests from different processes happens
+	 * to be present, at the same time, in the internal queue(s)
+	 * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
+	 * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
+	 * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
+	 * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
+	 * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
+	 * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
+	 * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
+	 * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired
+	 * device-throughput distribution only in a completely
+	 * symmetric scenario where: (i) each of these processes must
+	 * get the same throughput as the others; (ii) all these
+	 * processes have the same I/O pattern (either sequential or
+	 * random).  In fact, in such a scenario, the drive will tend
+	 * to treat the requests of each of these processes in about
+	 * the same way as the requests of the others, and thus to
+	 * provide each of these processes with about the same
+	 * throughput (which is exactly the desired throughput
+	 * distribution). In contrast, in any asymmetric scenario,
+	 * device idling is certainly needed to guarantee that bfqq
+	 * receives its assigned fraction of the device throughput
+	 * (see [1] for details).
+	 *
+	 * As for sub-condition (i), actually we check only whether
+	 * bfqq is being weight-raised. In fact, if bfqq is not being
+	 * weight-raised, we have that:
+	 * - if the process associated with bfqq is not I/O-bound, then
+	 *   it is not either latency- or throughput-critical; therefore
+	 *   idling is not needed for bfqq;
+	 * - if the process asociated with bfqq is I/O-bound, then
+	 *   idling is already granted with bfqq (see the comments on
+	 *   idling_boosts_thr).
+	 *
+	 * We do not check sub-condition (ii) at all, i.e., the next
+	 * variable is true if and only if bfqq is being
+	 * weight-raised. We do not need to control sub-condition (ii)
+	 * for the following reason:
+	 * - if bfqq is being weight-raised, then idling is already
+	 *   guaranteed to bfqq by sub-condition (i);
+	 * - if bfqq is not being weight-raised, then idling is
+	 *   already guaranteed to bfqq (only) if it matters, i.e., if
+	 *   bfqq is associated to a currently I/O-bound process (see
+	 *   the above comment on sub-condition (i)).
+	 *
+	 * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
+	 * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the
+	 * following unlucky scenario: if idling is (correctly)
+	 * disabled in a time period during which the symmetry
+	 * sub-condition holds, and hence the device is allowed to
+	 * enqueue many requests, but at some later point in time some
