Yes, that would be my approach. I have seen reports like that already
but that was mostly because of heavy caching on the SLUB side on older
kernels. So there surely are workloads with small limits configured
(e.g. 20MB). On the other hand those users were receptive to adapt their
limits as they were kinda arbitrary anyway.

Yes, this not an easy thing to get right. I was mostly thinking some
auto scaling based on the limit size or growing the stock if cache hits
are common and decrease when stocks get flushed often because multiple
memcgs compete over the same pcp stock. But to me it seems like a per
memcg approach might lead better results without too many heuristics
(albeit more memory hungry).

No, that was exactly my thinking as well.
