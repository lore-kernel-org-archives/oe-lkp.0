'pin' refers to pinned file feature in F2FS, the LBA(Logical Block =

Address) of a file is fixed after pinned. Without this operation before =

fallocate, the LBA may not align with section(F2FS GC unit), some LBA of =

the file may be changed by F2FS GC in some extreme cases.

For this test case, how about pin the swap file before fallocate for =

F2FS as following:

ioctl(fd, F2FS_IOC_SET_PIN_FILE, true);
