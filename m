Looking at the config, it's a static debug with report luns enabled. =

 Is it as simple as the fact that we probe lun 0 manually to see if the
target exists, but then we don't account for the fact that we already
did this, so if it turns up again in the report lun scan, we'll probe
it again leading to a double add.  If that theory is correct, this may
be the fix (compile tested only).
