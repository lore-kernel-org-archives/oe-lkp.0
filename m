Hi,

Thanks for the report.

I guess the commit isn't actually an upstream commit, but one the robot
made when applying the patch?

This URL doesn't work (any more?)

[... similar results ...]

As on the previous version of this report (which had different test
cases failing IIRC), I can't reproduce this on my tree, even with your
kernel config. Since I can't actually look at the tree state that you
had (mac80211-next + patch, but which mac80211-next?), I can't
reproduce entirely.
