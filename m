But this patch is about GFP_ATOMIC allocations, I doubt your test is
using GFP_ATOMIC.

Threads (process context) should use GFP_KERNEL allocations.

BTW, if 100 threads are simultaneously trying to vmalloc(32 MB), this
might not be very wise :(

Only one should really do this, while others are waiting.

If we really want parallelism (multiple cpus coordinating their effort),
it should be done very differently.
