The test uses the user.* xattr namespace which should be unaffected by
the xattr changes we did the last few cycles.

If the xattrs aren't storable in the inode then they are stored in a
separate block. The consist of a header and after that is an array of
struct ext4_xattr_entry entries.

Each of the entries store a hash value e_hash which is a hash of the
xattr name and xattr value.

The aforementioned header contains another h_hash field which seems to
be a hash of all e_hash fields of all xattrs.

For in-inode/ea-inode xattrs a hash for xattr name and value is stored
on disk as well but there's no header. The i_atime field contains a
checksum of only the value that is stored in the inode.

IOW, the bug might also depend on how the xattrs are stored. For
example, what xattrs might be stored in the inode depends on the inode
size that is chosen when the filesystem is created. But if I'm not
mistaken, it also depends on the block size.
So if the block size chosen for x86 differs from arm that might have an
impact on how the xattrs are stored and thus make the bug more or less
likely to appear?...
