Are there nominations for most comprehensive changelog of the year? :)
This is awesome.

> Fengguang reported [1] random corruptions from various locations on

> config") and 9d876e79df6a ("bpf: fix unlocking of jited image when
> module ronx not set") that uses the former. While x86-32 doesn't
> have a JIT like x86_64, the bpf_prog_lock_ro() and bpf_prog_unlock_ro()
> got enabled due to ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY, whereas Fengguang's test
> kernel doesn't have module support built in and therefore never
> had the DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX setting enabled.
>
> After investigating the crashes further, it turned out that using
> set_memory_ro() and set_memory_rw() didn't have the desired effect,
> for example, setting the pages as read-only on x86-32 would still
> let probe_kernel_write() succeed without error. This behavior would
> manifest itself in situations where the vmalloc'ed buffer was accessed
> prior to set_memory_*() such as in case of bpf_prog_alloc(). In
> cases where it wasn't, the page attribute changes seemed to have
> taken effect, leading to the conclusion that a TLB invalidate
> didn't happen. Moreover, it turned out that this issue reproduced
> with qemu in "-cpu kvm64" mode, but not for "-cpu host". When the
> issue occurs, change_page_attr_set_clr() did trigger a TLB flush
> as expected via __flush_tlb_all() through cpa_flush_range(), though.

> There are 3 variants for issuing a TLB flush: invpcid_flush_all()
> (depends on CPU feature bits X86_FEATURE_INVPCID, X86_FEATURE_PGE),
> cr4 based flush (depends on X86_FEATURE_PGE), and cr3 based flush.
> For "-cpu host" case in my setup, the flush used invpcid_flush_all()
> variant, whereas for "-cpu kvm64", the flush was cr4 based. Switching
> the kvm64 case to cr3 manually worked fine, and further investigating
> the cr4 one turned out that X86_CR4_PGE bit was not set in cr4
> register, meaning the __native_flush_tlb_global_irq_disabled() wrote
> cr4 twice with the same value instead of clearing X86_CR4_PGE in the
> first write to trigger the flush.
>
> It turned out that X86_CR4_PGE was cleared from cr4 during init
> from lguest_arch_host_init() via adjust_pge(). The X86_FEATURE_PGE
> bit is also cleared from there due to concerns of using PGE in
> guest kernel that can lead to hard to trace bugs (see bff672e630a0
> ("lguest: documentation V: Host") in init()). The CPU feature bits
> are cleared in dynamic boot_cpu_data, but they never propagated to
> __flush_tlb_all() as it uses static_cpu_has() instead of boot_cpu_has()
> for testing which variant of TLB flushing to use, meaning they still
> used the old setting of the host kernel.
>
> Clearing via setup_clear_cpu_cap(X86_FEATURE_PGE) so this would
> propagate to static_cpu_has() checks is too late at this point as
> sections have been patched already, so for now, it seems reasonable
> to switch back to boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_PGE) as it was prior to
> commit c109bf95992b ("x86/cpufeature: Remove cpu_has_pge"). This
> lets the TLB flush trigger via cr3 as originally intended, properly
> makes the new page attributes visible and thus fixes the crashes
> seen by Fengguang.
