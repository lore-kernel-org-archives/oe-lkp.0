The bisect is pointing to a commit which is almost 5 months old, so this
is pre-ORC.  Kallsyms *is* enabled, but the unwinder dump isn't smart
enough to realize it's dumping misaligned stack addresses:

[  110.399425] WARNING: kernel stack regs at bd92bc2e in 01-cpu-hotplug:381=
1 has bad 'bp' value 000001be
[  110.399428] unwind stack type:0 next_sp:  (null) mask:0x2 graph_idx:0
[  110.399431] bd92bc2e: 92bc7f00 (0x92bc7f00)
[  110.399433] bd92bc32: c27041bd (0xc27041bd)

So kallsyms doesn't help if I'm dumping bad data.  Oops.

I tried to recreate it with the reproducer script and a similar GCC
version, but no luck.

Fengguang, assuming it's reliably recreatable, any chance you could
recreate with the following patch?
