You are both right and I was wrong.  I stopped at
__blk_mq_issue_directly() and blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list() and missed
that every caller goes through this macro.  So synchronize_rcu()
does wait for a running loop_queue_rq() with the current loop
setup.  I withdraw that comment.

That was Bart's suggestion from his earlier review, and I passed
it on while assuming the synchronize_rcu() was unfounded.  With
the RCU pairing confirmed, there is nothing left to replace and
the quiesce suggestion is moot.

The decrement part I would still reword: for BLK_STS_OK the
reference is held until the request is freed, and that is the
property blk_mq_freeze_queue() relies on.  But you are right that
the activity ceases, and for a simpler reason than the freeze:

An io_uring fixed file holds a reference to the struct file, so
bd_openers never reaches zero and lo_release() does not start
while such a submission path exists.  Any submission needs an
open block device file (or a mount holding it), so "openers == 0
but submissions continue" needs no additional mechanism.  I'll
drop the io_uring part.

Your udev-worker sequence shows that synchronous completion was
never guaranteed and -EBUSY or -ENXIO transients were already
possible.  I accept that.  The remaining difference is only that
the window now exists after every close instead of requiring an
interleaving close from another opener, and if programs must
tolerate transient errors anyway, that is not a blocker.
