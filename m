you don't even get to fire up trinity. With and without the patch you
crash very early.

There is no successful boot. The pattern changes with patch in question
applied.

yes. With and without the patch there is a lot of wrong stuff like
complains about a kobject initialized again. This leads to a double free
at some point.

What happens is the following: CONFIG_SCSI_DEBUG is enabled which adds a
dummy host controller with a dummy disk. This gets probed during boot.
Since you also enabled CONFIG_DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE it gets removed
and re-added. The request_queue in genhd disk is re-used while the disk
is added for the second time:

Since you also need CONFIG_SCSI_MQ_DEFAULT enabled I assume the MQ block
code is buggy here.
But commit b332151a29 in Paul's tree innocent.
