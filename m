thanks for testing this on another arch then ARM!

The problem is that the weak arch_scale_cpu_capacity calls =

default_scale_cpu_capacity on a system which doesn't overwrite it and =

the default one accesses the sched_domain which is not allocated that =

early when called by scheduler_tick.

I only tested it on an ARM system which in this tree which overwrites =

arch_scale_cpu_capacity and does not access sched_domain.

Have to look into it and will test the default case from now on too.
