 What do you think the right approach here? Send a patch for this to the ML=
 for adding the check as a potential fix? Or someone can help me investigat=
e the crash dump and root cause it? or if we can use test robot to confirm =
this, I can re-send the patch ASIS to the list. Please clarify.

If the assumption is that the pointers can never be NULL,
wouldn't it be important to see a call trace and to find out
if the NULL pointers can actually be seen by design,
or if there is some other bug ?

I am a bit concerned that adding those NULL pointer checks
might end up hiding some other bug, ie that they just hide
the real bug without fixing it.
