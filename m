The polling could work but that would be somehow reinventing the
wait/complete.

I am not aware of such. Anyone?

The problem is that __cpu_die() (waiting for completion signal) may cut
the power of dying CPU.

It could however wait for all RCU callbacks before powering down.
rcu_barrier() would do the trick?

	rcu_barrier();
        if (!platform_cpu_kill(cpu))
                pr_err("CPU%u: unable to kill\n", cpu);

Krzysztof
