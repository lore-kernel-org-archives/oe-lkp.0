Hmm, actually looking at this, it's worse than what you stated. This is
called when a directory is closed. So if you had:

	open(dir);

	// look at all the content of this dir to create dentries

	// another task creates a new entry and looks at it too.

	close(dir);

Now we iterate over all the dentries of the dir and dput it.

I think this will cause the ref counts to get out of sync. I'll have to try
to create this scenario and see what happens.

I believe this is to keep this and create_file_dentry() in sync.

But I need to look deeper. I'm still very new with understanding how all
this file system code works :-p
