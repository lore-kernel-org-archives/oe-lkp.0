The nbcon should be awake because there is outstanding printing to be
done as far as I understand. It is just not running or behind. So you
would need just wait until the thread is done before you continue.

This pops up now because the 8250 does it via the thread now. If you
don't have an atomic console implementation but use the thread anyway
(say the PREEMPT_RT case) then you would end up with the same problem,
right?

Recently I did play with CPU shutdown and noticed that PREEMPT_RT misses
an irq_work sync which explained missing printk output. You probably
recall the printk part of this :)

Now that I look more into it, the above with pr_flush() does not work
because by the time SYSTEM_SUSPEND is assigned it expects interrupts to
be disabled (or disables them a few lines earlier).

emergency_restart() looks like a bad candidate for a flush.
kernel_restart_prepare() on the other hand would be good. And there is a
flush in kernel_power_off().

In general I would expect sysrq-b to reboot immediately without the
flush but an ordinary reboot should flush.

But if we have more than one console and more than one CPU we could let
them flush in parallel and just wait for them do be done?

same as PREEMPT_RT.

So maybe just identify the few spots in the reboot case.
