The approach of virtualizing the xattrs on the name-side, which is what =

this patch does, provides a more general approach than to virtualizing =

it on the value side, which is what Serge does in his other patch for =

security.capability alone. With the virtualizing on-the-value side =

virtualizing the xattr becomes an exercise that needs to be repeated for =

every xattr name that one would want to virtualize. With this patch you =

would just add another xattr name to a list, a one-line patch in the =

end. Xattr with prefixes like trusted.* need a bit more work but this =

can be woven in as well =

(https://github.com/stefanberger/linux/commit/397b1a3b24045c67405fc83465e54=
4fc865d402f).

For virtualizing the xattrs on the 'value' side I was looking for =

whether there's something like a 'wrapper' structure around the actual =

value of the xattr so that that wrapper could be extended to support =

different values at different uids and applied to any xattr. =

Unfortunately there's no such 'wrapper'.
