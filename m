Ah, good point.

Well, you do set the timeout to five seconds, and so if the condition
does not get set before the surviving CPU finds its way to the
out_of_line_wait_on_bit_timeout(), you are guaranteed to wait for at
least five seconds.

One alternative approach would be to have a loop around a series of
shorter waits.  Other thoughts?

Just trying to clean up this particular corner at the moment.  ;-)

Again, I believe that you will need to loop over a shorter timeout
in order to get reasonable latencies.  If waiting a millisecond at
a time is an energy-efficiency concern (don't know why it would be
in this rare case, but...), then one approach would be to start
with very short waits, then increase the wait time, for example,
doubling the wait time on each pass through the loop would result
in a smallish number of wakeups, but would mean that you waited
no more than twice as long as necessary.

Thoughts?

							Thanx, Paul
