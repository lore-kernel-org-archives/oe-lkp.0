No, I don't have a patch. It may not be possible to implement it. The =

xattr_handler's  take the name of the xattr as input to get(). So one =

could try to encode the mapped uid in the name. However, that could lead =

to problems with stale xattrs in a shared filesystem over time unless =

one could limit the number of xattrs with the same prefix, e.g., =

security.capability*. So I doubt that it would work. Otherwise it would =

be good if the value was wrapped in a data structure use by all xattrs, =

but that doesn't seem to be the case, either. So I guess we have to go =

into each type of value structure and add a uid field there.
