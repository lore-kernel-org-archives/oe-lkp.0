A file shared by 2 containers, one mapping root to uid=3D1000, the other =

mapping root to uid=3D2000, will show these two xattrs on the host =

(init_user_ns) once these containers set xattrs on that file.

Note that we do keep compatibility to existing behavior. The =

security.foo of the host is visible inside any container for as long as =

the container root user doesn't set its own security.foo on that file, =

which then hides it. Does that address this concern?

In the current implementation BAR is visible inside of any instance that =

'covers' this uid with the mapping range. Above example of =

security.foo(a)uid=3D1000 appears as security.foo inside the container with =

root mapping to uid 1000 (@uid=3D0 is suppressed) but also appears as =

security.foo(a)uid=3D100 with root uid mapping to 900 (and range of at leas=
t =

101).

Can you define what 'scalable' means for you in this context?
 From what I can see sharing a filesystem between multiple containers =

doesn't 'scale well' for virtualizing the xattrs primarily because of =

size limitations of xattrs per file.
