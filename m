The original number is 94500 for ivb42 machine, the 162245 is the sum
of the two numbers above it that are tested on two machines - one is the
number for ivb42 and one is for lkp-snb01. Sorry if that is not clear.

And for the numbers I have given with your patch applied, they are all
for ivb42 alone.

The throughput has almost no change. Your 2nd patch with scale changed
has seen a decrease of 0.1% compared to your original commit that
triggered the report, and that original commit has a increase of 1.2%
compared to its parent commit.
