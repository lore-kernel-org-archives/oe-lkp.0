It has privilege within the bounding set of the capabilities that it is =

given. Afaik, a process cannot gain additional capabilities through file =

capabilities. Allowing to set a process's file capabilities allows one =

to _restrict_ what it can do, which is useful for shared filesystems =

where I can now set my ping capabilities to cap_net_raw, overriding the =

ones one the host which could be cap_net_admin+cap_net_raw. So I don't =

need to extend my bounding set with cap_net_admin or mess with xattrs on =

the host.
