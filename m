Did that now in a 2nd patch (that also fixes a few problems of the 1st). =

In a user ns mapped to 1000 root can write security.capability(a)uid=3D123, =

which then ends up writing to security.capability(a)uid=3D1123. The reading =

also works with @uid=3D123. When listing xattrs only those get shown that =

actually have valid mappings.
