Thank you.

The raised issues are for patches [1] and [2].

The issue around [1] is whether there is Kconfig solution for the problem o=
f =

selecting at least one or more than one configure option from a set of =

options. This should avoid having a module init function with returns an =

error. The selection of DRBG cores shall allow the user to compile the DRBG=
 to =

suit his needs and reduce the footprint of the DRBG. Since at least one DRB=
G =

core must be selected as otherwise the DRBG is meaningless. Unfortunately I =

have not found a solution with Kconfig and all given suggestions also did n=
ot =

lead to a solution. So, if anybody has a suggestion on how to solve the iss=
ue, =

I will try it out.

Regarding [2], the issue is that ARRAY_SIZE returns different variable type=
s =

on different platforms (e.g. unsigned long on x86_64 vs unsigned int on i38=
6). =

Thus I have to use a type cast. This issue may be fixed by forcing a =

particular type to ARRAY_SIZE. Such change, however, may have quite some =

ripple effects throughout the kernel. Therefore, IMHO such a patch should n=
ot =

be made in the realm of the DRBG patchset and the type cast should be allow=
ed.
