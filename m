security.ima contains either a file hash or a signature.  (file data)
security.evm contains either a signature or an hmac of the security
xattrs and other file metadata. (file meta-data)

The same rules would apply to security.evm, as described in my
response. =C2=A0Based on it's view of the security xattrs, either the
native or namespace security.evm would be updated.

Only files that are in the IMA-appraisal policy is the file hash
calculated and written out as security.ima. =C2=A0Depending this policy,
does the security.ima exist. =C2=A0So if the file is in policy for both the
native and namespace policies, agreed the same hash doesn't need to be
written as two different xattrs.

Right, the namespace would require it's own EVM key. =

We definitely want to support different policies on the native and in
the namespace with different keys and keyrings.

Refer to Mehmet Kaaylap's recent post, which refers to a PoC version
of IMA namespacing - kernsec.org/pipermail/linux-security-module-
archive/2017-July/002286.html.

Agreed.

We need to resolve the xattr issue in order to namespace IMA-
