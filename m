Reusable code has merit, as it reduces the maintenance burden.

My big question right now is can you implement Ted's suggested
restriction.  Only one security.foo or secuirty.foo(a)... attribute ?

The maintenance gains are definitely worth taking if they do not
penalize the common case.

Different values at different uids currently appear to be undesirable.
At least for security.capable it does not appear to be useful.

A wrapper structure is also a reasonable suggestion.  Put it's magic
number/version code where the existing version code is away we go.

Do you know of cases where we will truly want to have different
attributes for different containers?

The case that I can think of for IMA is that the signatures want to be
conntected to a key that goes with the filesystem image (so not a system
key) but that would not be something that would need to be changed
between containers.
