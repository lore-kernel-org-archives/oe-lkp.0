On the host I can simply overwrite capabilities. I think the same model =

should apply to the virtualized world. The difference still is that =

removing an xattr, if written on the host, may only be possible by copy =

+ file move to original filename.

On IMA, when appending a letter to an executable, the executable doesn't =

run anymore when appraisal is used, but the signature is still there and =

needs to be re-written. Though I think this aspect on how they disappear =

doesn't matter as much if they can simply be overwritten.

Some things could certainly be solved with flags indicating behaviors of =

xattrs for as long as these flags only affect the reading, listing, and =

re-writing of the virtualized xattrs, which is what the patch does. For =

example a flag for security.capability could say that only a single =

'security.capability(@uid=3D<uid>)?' may exist while security.ima could =

have two.
