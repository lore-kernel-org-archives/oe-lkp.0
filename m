Actually, when you look closely, it's not a double add; it's an
add/remove/add.  You can see this from

[    6.488377] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Synchronizing SCSI cache

That's from sd_shutdown() as the driver is removing.  It looks like
something with the config caused the built in SCSI debug to do this
(not sure why), but since the stack trace is in block, I think the bug
is in the remove path: something didn't release the mq object
correctly.
