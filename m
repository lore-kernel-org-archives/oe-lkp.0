Probably as a more global improvement. I believe it's used very
often on hotpath, where it's known it can't be < 0, so for now
I'd pick the check inside this function.

Sure, sending in a couple hours. I guess it would be nice to get
Acked-by from a maintainer of that subsys (if it won't take too
long).

I like the idea!
