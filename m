Hi Viresh,

Let me explain why I think this is happening.

1. tick_nohz_irq_enter/exit() both get called *only if the cpu is idle*
and receives an interrupt.

2. Commit 2a16fc93d2c9568e1, cancels programming of tick_sched timer
in its handler, assuming that tick_nohz_irq_exit() will take care of
programming the clock event device appropriately, and hence it would
requeue or cancel the tick_sched timer.

3. But the intel_powerclamp driver injects an idle period only.
*The CPU however is not idle*. It has work on its runqueue and the
rq->curr !=3D idle. This means that *tick_nohz_irq_enter()/exit() will not
get called on any interrupt*.

4. As a consequence, when we get a hrtimer interrupt during the period
that the powerclamp driver is mimicking idle, the exit path of the
interrupt never calls tick_nohz_irq_exit(). Hence the tick_sched timer
that would have got removed due to the above commit will not get
enqueued back on for any pending timers that there might be. Besides
this, *jiffies never gets updated*.

5. If you look at the code of the powerclamp driver, clamp_thread()
loops on jiffies getting updated. It continues to do so with preemption
disabled and no tick_sched timer to force a scheduler tick to update the
jiffies. Since this happens on cpus in a package, all of them get soft
lockedup.

Hope the above explanation makes sense.
