Seems that the robot failed to parse the commit log correctly due to
the "Reported-by: xxx" line missed '>' in the end, the robot got fooled
by it and generated wrong result, we'll try to improve it to handle this
kind of case.

    net: __skb_flow_dissect() must cap its return value
    =

    After Tom patch, thoff field could point past the end of the buffer,
    this could fool some callers.
    =

    If an skb was provided, skb->len should be the upper limit.
    If not, hlen is supposed to be the upper limit.
    =

    Fixes: a6e544b0a88b ("flow_dissector: Jump to exit code in __skb_flow_d=
issect")
