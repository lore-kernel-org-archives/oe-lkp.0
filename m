That sounds like it would keep us to one xattr of any given type so yes.

It occurs to me while I am writing this that this is also important
for ima/evm.  There is an xattr that has a hash of all of the other
security relevant xattrs.   Without a limit on the number of xattrs
calculating that security xattr could become time prohibitive.
