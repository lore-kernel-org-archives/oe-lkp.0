Perfect !!

Yeah, you can call my fix a Hacky one. I agree..

But I don't know if calling tick_nohz_irq_exit() from these threads wouldn't
be hacky as well. And ofcourse my knowledge wouldn't be adequate here to
judge that :)

It looked a bit odd to me. Why should we call irq-exit from the threads wor=
king
with idle? And that's not what we do even for the real-idle loop as well ..

Also from Jacob's referenced patch, we would be moving to a consolidated
idle-loop for both real idle and threads like powerclamp, and this part may=
 be
tricky then..

Untested, but what about something like this?

I am not sure of the purpose of the idle-checks in the irq-paths.
All I understood from git logs is, these are to check if we
came out of dynticks mode and need to start/stop ticks again..

Then why not handle these idle mimicking threads as well?
We just need to check ts->idle_active which will take care of both
the cases, real idle and these threads..

Sorry, if this will break things further :(
