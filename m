Looks good to me. You can add my Reviewed-by to the above patch.

I have tested this fix and confirm powerclamp is working properly now.

However, we also have a planned patch for consolidated idle loop. With this=
 patch it causes some erratic behavior in idle injection.
I can=E2=80=99t seem to synchronize/align idle time around jiffies with thi=
s patch + fix.

Any suggestions welcome.
