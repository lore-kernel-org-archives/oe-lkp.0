Hello everyone,

I've carefully worked with this report, let me share the results.

This bot has been running trinity at the following points:

    just after stackleak was merged into 4.20-rc1

The following oopses happened on 4.20-rc1 and disappeared on 4.20-rc7:

They are caused by stackleak issues with ftrace and kprobes, that are fixed
in these commits:
    e9c7d656610e
    ef1a84093489

I've double-checked that now stackleak works properly with function tracing,
function_graph tracing and kprobes.

These 3 lines are not meaningful to me.

This is interesting. How does KASAN work with stackleak? I tested it using
test_kasan.ko -- it works properly both for KASAN outline and inline
instrumentation.

However I noticed that stackleak lkdtm test sometimes reports that kernel
stack is not properly erased in case of KASAN outline instrumentation.
I think it happens because KASAN increases kernel stack usage, so
CONFIG_STACKLEAK_TRACK_MIN_SIZE should be adjusted. I will investigate
that later.

Unfortunately, I can't extract anything useful from these lines.
And trinity doesn't provide reproducers...

Anyway, I've created exactly the same trinity setup and have been running
it for 2 days (900 tests) on 4.20-rc7 -- no kernel crashes were hit.

Best regards,
Alexander
