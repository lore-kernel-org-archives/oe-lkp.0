Yes, sorry! Even though the "first bad" commit a0f9ec1f1 and its
parent commit 2074b6e38 has clear and stable performance changes:

5 runs of a0f9ec1f1:

  "will-it-scale.per_thread_ops": [
    983098,
    985112,
    982690,
    976157,
    986606
  ],

5 runs of 2074b6e38:

  "will-it-scale.per_thread_ops": [
    1027667,
    1029414,
    1026736,
    1025678,
    1026871
  ],

Comparing the bisect-good and bisect-bad *kernels*, you'll find the
performance changes are not as stable:

        [*] bisect-good sample
        [O] bisect-bad  sample

So it might be some subtle data padding/alignment issue.
