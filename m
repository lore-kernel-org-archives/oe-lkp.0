You cannot stop testing it, because it is the default governor
algorithm for intel_pstate working in the active mode.

Yes, please!

Basically, I would recommend to test the following configurations by defaul=
t:

(1) scaling_driver =3D intel_pstate + scaling_governor =3D powersave

(2) scaling_driver =3D intel_cpufreq + scaling_governor =3D schedutil

The other ones are kind of less interesting.

[Note that in order to switch over from intel_pstate to intel_cpufreq,
you need to write "passive" into
/sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/status and if that write fails,
configuration (2) is not available and may be skipped.]

Not necessarily, maybe as a reference only if you have spare cycles.

Thanks!
