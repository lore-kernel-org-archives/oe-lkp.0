That sounds somewhat hacky, since I don't think fs should take care of swap
detailed format.

My premature suggesttion, how about
 a) for non-pinned files, f2fs_swap_activate() pins the file and move
    (reallocate) pre-fallocated data blocks if needed;
 b) for already pinned files and not section-aligned when
    f2fs_swap_activate(), just reject it.

I think it would pass the test since pinned operation is f2fs-specific only.
Or am I still missing something?
