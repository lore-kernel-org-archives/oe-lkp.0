Yes, I agree. The most likely explanation I see for this is that the
identified commit results in waking flush worker earlier so it may now
succeed in cleaning the page before get_dirty_bit() in the LTP testcase
manages to see it. This is a principial race in this testcase, you can
perhaps make it less likely but not completely fix it AFAICT.
