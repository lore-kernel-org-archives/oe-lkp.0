Adding x86 people too, since this seems to be something off about
ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY for x86-32.

The code seems to be shared between x86-32 and 64, I'm not seeing why
set_memory_r[ow]() should fail on one but not the other.

Considering that it seems to be flaky even on 32-bit, maybe it's
timing-related, or possibly related to TLB sizes or whatever (ie more
likely hidden by a larger TLB on more modern hardware?)

Anyway, just looking at change_page_attr_set_clr(), I notice that the
page alias checking treats NX specially:

        /* No alias checking for _NX bit modifications */
        checkalias =3D (pgprot_val(mask_set) | pgprot_val(mask_clr)) !=3D _=
PAGE_NX;

which seems insane. Why would NX be different from other protection
bits (like _PAGE_RW)?

But that doesn't explain why the bpf code would have issues with this
all only on x86-32.

Maybe somebody else can see why ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY would depend on
64-bit only..
