It doesn't scale. Shared filesystems are a problem if many containers =

use them.

'man listxattr' also mentions this here as a BUG:

" As noted in xattr(7), the VFS imposes a limit of 64 kB on the size of
        the extended attribute name list returned by listxattr(7). If the
        total size of attribute names attached to a file exceeds this limit,
        it is no longer possible to retrieve the list of attribute names."

A simple test on ext4:

#> touch foo
#> for ((i =3D 0; i < 200; i++)); do setfattr -n user.foo${i} -v hello =

foo; done

user.foo126 was the last one created...

Depending on the size of the data the xattrs are writing, the limit is =

reached sooner. Writing 'hellohello' only goes up to 'user.foo112'. =

Maybe one could try to encode the data more efficiently or as Serge did =

write the uid on the xattr value side, but either way, it won't scale =

due to that VFS limit.
