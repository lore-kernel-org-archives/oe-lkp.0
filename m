Yep.  That is what it looks like from here.

Which is why I asked the question about scalability of the xattr
implementations.  It looks like trying to accomodate the general
case just gets us in trouble, and sets unrealistic expectations.

Which strongly suggests that Serge's previous version that
just reved the format of security.capable so that a uid field could
be added is likely to be the better approach.

I want to see what Serge and Stefan have to say but the case looks
pretty clear cut at the moment.
