OK, so strncpy_from_user() or any other copy_from_user() should be
available for copying kernel memory if set_fs(KERNEL_DS).

I see, it ensures it is accessing user-memory.

Yeah, under init/ I saw such cases.

Yeah, that is what I've hit while testing :-(

Yes, that's just a hack :)

Would you mean implementing yet another "strncpy_from_user without
pagefault"? =

What we changed here is just use user_access_ok() instead access_ok() =

in user_access_begin() because access_ok() may cause false-positive
warning if we use it in IRQ.

I think the better way to do this is allowing strncpy_from_user()
if some conditions are match, like

 - strncpy_from_user() will be able to copy user memory with set_fs(USER_DS)
 - strncpy_from_user() can copy kernel memory with set_fs(KERNEL_DS)
 - strncpy_from_user() can access unsafe memory in IRQ context if
   pagefault is disabled.

This is almost done, except for CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=3Dy on x86.

So, what about adding a condition to WARN_ON_IN_IRQ() like below
instead of introducing user_access_ok() ?

+# define WARN_ON_IN_IRQ()      WARN_ON_ONCE(pagefault_disabled() && !in_ta=
sk())

Of course we have to move pagefault_disabled() macro in somewhere better pl=
ace.
