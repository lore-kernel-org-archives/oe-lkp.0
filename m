So correct me if I am wrong; in general, there will only be one
variant of the form:

   security.foo(a)uid=3D15000

It's not like there will be:

   security.foo(a)uid=3D1000
   security.foo(a)uid=3D2000

Except.... if you have an Distribution root directory which is shared
by many containers, you would need to put the xattrs in the overlay
inodes.  Worse, each time you launch a new container, with a new
subuid allocation, you will have to iterate over all files with
capabilities and do a copy-up operations on the xattrs in overlayfs.
So that's actually a bit of a disaster.

So for distribution overlays, you will need to do things a different
way, which is to map the distro subdirectory so you know that the
capability with the global uid 0 should be used for the container
"root" uid, right?

So this hack of using security.foo(a)uid=3D1000 is *only* useful when the
subcontainer root wants to create the privileged executable.  You
still have to do things the other way.

So can we make perhaps the assertion that *either*:

   security.foo

exists, *or*

   security.foo(a)uid=3DBAR

exists, but never both?  And there BAR is exclusive to only one
instances?

Otherwise, I suspect that the architecture is going to turn around and
bite us in the *ss eventually, because someone will want to do
something crazy and the solution will not be scalable.
