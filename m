You've got a variant of the "never asserted interrupt".

That condition is currently tested only once on probe in tpm_tis_core_init().
The solution would be to disable interrupts whenever they're not (or no
longer asserted).  

However, that's a distinct issue from the one addressed by the present
patch, which deals with a "never *de*asserted interrupt".

You're right that the user can't do anything about it and that
toning the message down to KERN_WARN or even KERN_NOTICE severity
may be appropriate.

However the above-quoted message for the never asserted interrupt
in tpm_tis_core_init() should then likewise be toned down to the
same severity.

I'm wondering why that message uses FW_BUG.  That doesn't make any
sense to me.  It's typically not a firmware bug, but a hardware issue,
e.g. an interrupt pin may erroneously not be connected or may be
connected to ground.  Lino used HW_ERR, which seems more appropriate
to me.

No.  The IRQ_HANDLED versus IRQ_NONE return values are merely used
for book-keeping of spurious interrupts.  If IRQ_HANDLED is returned,
the other handlers will still be invoked.  It is not discernible whether
a shared interrupt was asserted by a single device or by multiple devices,
so all handlers need to be called.

Thanks,
