I'm sorry but this patch series is simply bogus.

If rhashtable is indeed returning such errors under normal
conditions then rhashtable is broken and we must fix it instead
of working around it in the test code!

FWIW I still haven't been able to reproduce this problem, perhaps
because my machines have too few CPUs?

So can someone please help me reproduce this? Because just loading
test_rhashtable isn't doing it.

Thanks,
