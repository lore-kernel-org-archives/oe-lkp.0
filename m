Hello Jann and Andy,


The stackleak_erase() function is called on the trampoline stack at the end=
 of
syscall, it erases the used part of the kernel thread stack after the sysca=
ll is
handled.


I've reproduced such a double fault with function tracing for stackleak_era=
se():

  # mount -t tracefs nodev /sys/kernel/tracing
  # echo 'p:myprobe stackleak_erase' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/kprobe_eve=
nts
  # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kprobes/myprobe/enable


I think we should simply not allow function tracing for stackleak_*() funct=
ions:

diff --git a/kernel/Makefile b/kernel/Makefile
index 7343b3a..0906f6d 100644
--- a/kernel/Makefile
+++ b/kernel/Makefile
@@ -18,6 +18,7 @@ obj-$(CONFIG_MULTIUSER) +=3D groups.o
 ifdef CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER
 # Do not trace internal ftrace files
 CFLAGS_REMOVE_irq_work.o =3D $(CC_FLAGS_FTRACE)
+CFLAGS_REMOVE_stackleak.o =3D $(CC_FLAGS_FTRACE)
 endif


With this patch setting kprobe event for stackleak_erase() is not allowed. =
This
is the corresponding dmesg output:
  [   75.660478] trace_kprobe: Could not probe notrace function stackleak_e=
rase


If you agree, I'll prepare the patch for LKML.

Best regards,
Alexander
