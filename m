You can read sashiko's raw logs at https://sashiko.dev/#/log/49552 .

  Okay, let's break this down. My initial thought is to examine how the `blk_mq_run_dispatch_ops`
  macro is implemented. Specifically, how does it handle RCU read locks? It wraps the provided
  `dispatch_ops` in either `rcu_read_lock()` or `srcu_read_lock()`, depending on the `BLK_MQ_F_BLOCKING`
  flag. The loop device, however, is set up *without* this `BLK_MQ_F_BLOCKING` flag. Therefore,
  `loop_queue_rq` executes under the protection of `rcu_read_lock()`.

  Now, the critical question: Does the `synchronize_rcu()` call in `__loop_clr_fd` effectively address
  the potential race conditions? Since `loop_queue_rq()` is indeed RCU-protected, `synchronize_rcu()` will
  correctly wait for all currently executing instances of `loop_queue_rq()` to complete. Furthermore,
  the `lo_state` transition to `Lo_rundown` before calling `__loop_clr_fd` ensures that any *new* calls to
  `loop_queue_rq()` will see this state and return an error. This perfectly fences the execution of
  `loop_queue_rq()`. Moreover, `drain_workqueue()` then makes sure all queued works are completed, and
  these are scheduled by `loop_queue_rq()`. This is great; all scheduled works are completed before
  clearing `lo->lo_backing_file`.

synchronize_rcu() + drain_workqueue() can be implied by blk_mq_freeze_queue() + blk_mq_unfreeze_queue().
But why are you talking about blk_mq_quiesce_queue() + blk_mq_wait_quiesce_done() ?

If submissions can continue _forever_ despite disk_openers(disk) == 0, what
mechanism was preventing this problem from occurring until Linux 7.0 ?

Does whether the teardown being synchronous or asynchronous matter so much?

I don't think we can control when e.g. udev-worker becomes the thread
who actually calls __loop_clr_fd()
( https://lkml.kernel.org/r/9f8b5ab0-efbc-4cf3-a1f8-b43377416946@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp ).
Even if an existing user app calls close() immediately followed by open(),
we can't prove that __loop_clr_fd() is synchronously called by that user app
because udev-worker can jump in and udev-worker becomes the thread who actually
calls __loop_clr_fd().

   An user app     udev-worker
   -----------     -----------
                    open()
    close()
    open() // => succeeds due to Lo_bound state
    ioctl(LOOP_CONFIGURE) // => fails with -EBUSY due to Lo_bound state
    close() // <= gives up due to ioctl() failure
                    close() // => becomes  Lo_rundown and __loop_clr_fd() is called

A claim that mentions that the kernel is unable to release forever due to a refcount
leak bug is valid. But a claim that mentions that the kernel cannot prove that
this -ENXIO or -EBUSY problem never happens is invalid. Programs that use the loop
device have to be prepared for transient errors.
