It looks the robot does not catch that error, I cannot find
"iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp" in the logs.

Looking closer at the log files, I find they mostly fail at early
"make prepare" stage.

That may be a new regression introduced when we enable
multiple-compiler support recently, I'll try to fix it.
