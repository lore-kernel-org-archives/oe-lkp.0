Exactly.  It's this, I think

	bool test_remove =3D IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE) &&
			   !drv->suppress_bind_attrs;

You have that config option set.

So the drivers base layer is calling ->remove after probe and
triggering the destruction of the queue.

What to do about this (apart from nuke such a stupid option) is
somewhat more problematic.
