I test all my patches against the failing test-case and a few other images.

This patch specifically I think was sent with an [RFC] tag which I
intended to signal that I'm *not* sure of the fix.

That said, I could do a better job of running more conventional fs tests
on my patches, so I'll incorporate xfstests into my workflow.

Ugh, brain-o on my part. It should say > rather than >=3D, agreed?

The function (ext4_init_block_bitmap()) has even more problems than the
ones I reported to the list so far; ext4_block_bitmap(),
ext4_inode_bitmap(), and ext4_inode_table() may _also_ point outside the
buffer and cause random corruptions.

I'll try to come up with a new (and better tested) patch.

Thanks,
