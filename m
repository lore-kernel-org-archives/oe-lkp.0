Funky.  How did the kernel test robot suddenly figure out an 8-month
old problem?

This is a warning for somebody doing "remove_proc_entry() on a name
that doesn't actually exist in that /proc directory.

In this case, it does seem to be due to the named commit adding a

+               remove_proc_entry("settings", drive->proc);

to ide_proc_unregister_device(), and looking at the patch I get the
feeling that it's due to a typo: the code *creates* the file called
"setting", but removes the file "settings". Note the missing "s" at
creation time.

And yes, the name of the /proc file _should_be "settings", judging by
the rest of the patch.

So it does seem to be a real bug. Nobody noticed until now? Why did
the test robot suddenly react to it?
