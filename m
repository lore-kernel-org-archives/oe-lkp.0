This patch also changed the layout of 'struct mem_cgroup':

diff --git a/include/linux/memcontrol.h b/include/linux/memcontrol.h
index d99b71bc2c66..517096c3cc99 100644
--- a/include/linux/memcontrol.h
+++ b/include/linux/memcontrol.h
@@ -208,6 +210,9 @@ struct mem_cgroup {
 	atomic_long_t memory_events[MEMCG_NR_MEMORY_EVENTS];
 	struct cgroup_file events_file;
 =

+	/* handle for "memory.swap.events" */
+	struct cgroup_file swap_events_file;
+
 	/* protect arrays of thresholds */
 	struct mutex thresholds_lock;

And I'm guessing that might be the cause.
