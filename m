This might be the first time I've seen it trip up the bpf code iirc.
Daniel wrote some pretty nifty bpf generator code in trinity,
(net/bpf.c) that you might want to see if you can think of enhancing.

Though it might be the case that we're not even needing to do anything
that complicated to hit this particular bug..
