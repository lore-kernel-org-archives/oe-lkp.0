In the case of IMA appraisal the extended attribute security.ima would =

be a signature. For c1 and c2 to use that file they would all have to =

have the same key on their (isolated IMA namespace ) keyring. I think =

this type of setup could be arranged.
Following your attack description in the introduction I would say that =

we would want to prevent malicious modification of a security.ima =

extended attribute:

"Root in a non-initial user ns cannot be trusted to write a traditional sec=
urity.ima xattr. If it were allowed to do so, then any unprivileged user on=
 the host could map his own uid to root in a private namespace, write the s=
ignature in the security.ima xattr, and prevent the file from being accessi=
ble on the host."

I am not sure about that. I suppose any extended attribute modifications =

would have to be designed for the case where a shared filesystem is used =

that also shares the extended attributes, not assuming an overlay =

filesystem that automatically isolates the extend attributes. With the =

shared filesystem I'd like to prevent any type of setting of extended =

attributes by a child container or more generally anyone mounting it as =

a '2nd consumer', which would make it a shared filesystem. Only the =

process that mounts a filesystem as the '1st consumer' would be able to =

set the extended attributes. I am assuming that using an overlay fs =

would always make you the '1st consumer' -- I would hope that these =

conditions could be detected. And probably the process should also write =

along its host uid as part of writing out the xattr. If all extended =

attributes were to support this model, maybe the 'uid' could be =

associated with the 'name' of the xattr rather than its 'value' (not =

sure whether that's possible).
