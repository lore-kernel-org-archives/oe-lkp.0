In tpm_tis_probe_irq_single(), after you've requested the irq,
you could convert it to a struct irq_desc (via irq_to_desc()
from <linux/irqnr.h>) and cache that pointer in priv.

Then in tis_int_handler(), you could access the irqs_unhandled
member of struct irq_desc (from <linux/irqdesc.h>) and check
if it exceeds, say, 5000.

If it does, schedule a work_struct which calls disable_interrupts().
You can't call that from the IRQ handler because devm_free_irq()
waits for the IRQ handler to finish, so you'd deadlock.  You *can*
of course clear the TPM_GLOBAL_INT_ENABLE bit from the IRQ handler,
though it's unclear to me if that's sufficient to quiesce the
interrupt line.

By reusing the genirq subsystem's irqs_unhandled infrastructure,
you avoid having to reimplement all of that.

Thanks,

Lukas
